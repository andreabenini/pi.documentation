=== LED matrix

The LED matrix is an RGB565 https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt[framebuffer] with the id `RPi-Sense FB`. The appropriate device node can be written to as a standard file or mmap-ed. The included snake example shows how to access the framebuffer.

=== Joystick

The joystick comes up as an input event device named `Raspberry Pi Sense HAT Joystick`, mapped to the arrow keys and **Enter**. It should be supported by any library which is capable of handling inputs, or directly through the https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/input.txt[evdev interface]. Suitable libraries include SDL, http://www.pygame.org/docs/[pygame] and https://python-evdev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/[python-evdev]. The included `snake` example shows how to access the joystick directly.
