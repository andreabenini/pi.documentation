== Synchronous Captures

The High Quality (HQ) Camera supports synchronous captures.
One camera (the "source") can be configured to generate a pulse on its XVS (Vertical Sync) pin when a frame capture is initiated.
Other ("sink") cameras can listen for this pulse, and capture a frame at the same time as the source camera.

This method is largely superseded by xref:../computers/camera_software.adoc#software-camera-synchronisation[software camera synchronisation] which can operate over long distances without additional wires and has sub-millisecond accuracy. But when cameras are physically close, wired synchronisation may be used.

NOTE: Global Shutter (GS) Cameras can also be operated in a synchronous mode. However, the source camera will record one extra frame. Instead, for GS Cameras we recommend using an xref:camera.adoc#external-trigger-on-the-gs-camera[external trigger source]. You cannot synchronise a GS Camera and an HQ Camera.

=== Connecting the cameras

Solder a wire to the XVS test point of each camera, and connect them together.

Solder a wire to the GND test point of each camera, and connect them together.

*For GS Cameras only,* you will also need to connect the XHS (Horizontal Sync) test point of each camera together. On any GS Camera that you wish to act as a sink, bridge the two halves of the MAS pad with solder.

NOTE: An earlier version of this document recommended an external pull-up for XVS. This is no longer recommended. Instead, ensure you have the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS and set the `always-on` property for all connected cameras.

=== Driver configuration

You will need to configure the camera drivers to keep their 1.8V power supplies on when not streaming, and optionally to select the source and sink roles.

==== For the HQ Camera

Edit `/boot/firmware/config.txt`. Change `camera_auto_detect=1` to `camera_auto_detect=0`.

Append this line for a source camera:
[source]
----
dtoverlay=imx477,always-on,sync-source
----

Or for a sink:
[source]
----
dtoverlay=imx477,always-on,sync-sink
----

When using the CAM0 port on a Raspberry Pi 5, CM4 or CM5, append `,cam0` to that line without a space. If two cameras are on the same Raspberry Pi you will need two dtoverlay lines, only one of them ending with `,cam0`.

Alternatively, if you wish to swap the cameras' roles at runtime (and they are not both connected to the same Raspberry Pi), omit `,sync-source` or `,sync-sink` above. Instead you can set a module parameter before starting each camera:

For the Raspbery Pi with the source camera:
[source,console]
----
$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/imx477/parameters/trigger_mode
----

For the Raspberry Pi with the sink camera:
[source,console]
----
$ echo 2 | sudo tee /sys/module/imx477/parameters/trigger_mode
----
You will need to do this every time the system is booted.

==== For the GS Camera

Edit `/boot/firmware/config.txt`. Change `camera_auto_detect=1` to `camera_auto_detect=0`.

For either a source or a sink, append this line:
[source]
----
dtoverlay=imx296,always-on
----
When using the CAM0 port on a Raspberry Pi 5, CM4 or CM5, append `,cam0` to that line without a space. If two cameras are on the same Raspberry Pi you will need two dtoverlay lines, only one of them ending with `,cam0`.

On the GS Camera, the sink role is enabled by the MAS pin and cannot be configured by software ("trigger_mode" and "sync-sink" relate to the xref:camera.adoc#external-trigger-on-the-gs-camera[external trigger method], and should _not_ be set for this method).

=== Libcamera configuration

If the cameras are not all started within 1 second, the `rpicam` applications can time out. To prevent this, you must edit a configuration file on any Raspberry Pi(s) with sink cameras.

On Raspberry Pi 5 or CM5:
[source,console]
----
$ cp /usr/share/libcamera/pipeline/rpi/pisp/example.yaml timeout.yaml
----

On other Raspberry Pi models:
[source,console]
----
$ cp /usr/share/libcamera/pipeline/rpi/vc4/rpi_apps.yaml timeout.yaml
----

Now edit the copy. In both cases, delete the `#` (comment) from the `"camera_timeout_value_ms":` line, and change the number to `60000` (60 seconds).

=== Starting the cameras

Run the following commands to start the sink:

[source,console]
----
$ export LIBCAMERA_RPI_CONFIG_FILE=timeout.yaml
$ rpicam-vid --frames 300 --qt-preview -o sink.h264
----

Wait a few seconds, then run the following command to start the source:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-vid --frames 300 --qt-preview -o source.h264
----
Frames should be synchronised. Use `--frames` to ensure the same number of frames are captured, and that the recordings are exactly the same length.
Running the sink first ensures that no frames are missed.

NOTE: When using the GS camera in synchronous mode, the sink will not record exactly the same number of frames as the source. **The source records one extra frame before the sink starts recording**. Because of this, you need to specify that the sink records one less frame with the `--frames` option.
