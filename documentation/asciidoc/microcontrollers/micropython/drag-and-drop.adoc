== Drag-and-Drop MicroPython

You can program your Pico by connecting it to a computer via USB, then dragging and dropping a file onto it so we've put together a downloadable UF2 file to let you install MicroPython more easily.

NOTE: MicroPython distributions for other RP2040- and RP2350-based boards are available on the https://micropython.org/download/[MicroPython download page].

To program your device, follow these steps:

. Push and hold the BOOTSEL button while connecting your Pico with a USB cable to a computer. Release the BOOTSEL button once your Pico appears as a Mass Storage Device called RPI-RP2.

. Drag and drop the MicroPython UF2 file onto the RPI-RP2 volume. Your Pico will reboot. You are now running MicroPython.

. Access the REPL via USB Serial.

The https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-python-sdk.pdf[Raspberry Pi Pico-series Python SDK] book contains step-by-step instructions for connecting to your Pico and programming it in MicroPython using both the command line and the https://thonny.org/[Thonny] IDE.
