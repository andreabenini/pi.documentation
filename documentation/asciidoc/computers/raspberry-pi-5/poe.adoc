The Ethernet jack on Raspberry Pi 5 is PoE+ capable, supporting the IEEE 802.3at-2009 PoE standard. The Raspberry Pi 5 has a 4-pin Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) header block, located between the Ethernet jack and the two MIPI connectors.

The Raspberry Pi PoE+ HAT for Raspberry Pi 5 is an add-on board for Raspberry Pi 5 computers which connects to the PoE header. It is used to power your Raspberry Pi via an Ethernet cable, provided that power-sourcing equipment is installed on the Ethernet network.
