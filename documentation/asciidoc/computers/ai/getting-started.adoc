== Getting Started

This guide will help you set up a Hailo NPU with your Raspberry Pi 5. This will enable you to run `rpicam-apps` camera demos using an AI neural network accelerator.

=== Prerequisites

For this guide, you will need the following:

* a Raspberry Pi 5
* one of the following NPUs:
** a xref:../accessories/ai-kit.adoc[Raspberry Pi AI Kit], which includes:
*** an M.2 HAT+
*** a pre-installed Hailo-8L AI module
** a xref:../accessories/ai-hat-plus.adoc[Raspberry Pi AI HAT+]
* a 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm install
* any official Raspberry Pi camera (e.g. Camera Module 3 or High Quality Camera)

=== Hardware setup

. Attach the camera to your Raspberry Pi 5 board following the instructions at xref:../accessories/camera.adoc#install-a-raspberry-pi-camera[Install a Raspberry Pi Camera]. You can skip reconnecting your Raspberry Pi to power, because you'll need to disconnect your Raspberry Pi from power for the next step.

. Depending on your NPU, follow the installation instructions for the xref:../accessories/ai-kit.adoc#ai-kit-installation[AI Kit] or xref:../accessories/ai-hat-plus.adoc#ai-hat-plus-installation[AI HAT+], to get your hardware connected to your Raspberry Pi 5.

. Follow the instructions to xref:raspberry-pi.adoc#pcie-gen-3-0[enable PCIe Gen 3.0]. This step is optional, but _highly recommended_ to achieve the best performance with your NPU.

. Install the dependencies required to use the NPU. Run the following command from a terminal window:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt install hailo-all
----
+
This installs the following dependencies:
+
* Hailo kernel device driver and firmware
* HailoRT middleware software
* Hailo Tappas core post-processing libraries
* The `rpicam-apps` Hailo post-processing software demo stages

. Finally, reboot your Raspberry Pi with `sudo reboot` for these settings to take effect.

. To ensure everything is running correctly, run the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ hailortcli fw-control identify
----
+
If you see output similar to the following, you've successfully installed the NPU and its software dependencies:
+
----
Executing on device: 0000:01:00.0
Identifying board
Control Protocol Version: 2
Firmware Version: 4.17.0 (release,app,extended context switch buffer)
Logger Version: 0
Board Name: Hailo-8
Device Architecture: HAILO8L
Serial Number: HLDDLBB234500054
Part Number: HM21LB1C2LAE
Product Name: HAILO-8L AI ACC M.2 B+M KEY MODULE EXT TMP
----
+
NOTE: AI HAT+ devices may show `<N/A>` for `Serial Number`, `Part Number` and `Product Name`. This is expected, and does not impact functionality.
+
Additionally, you can run `dmesg | grep -i hailo` to check the kernel logs, which should yield output similar to the following:

. To ensure the camera is operating correctly, run the following command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello -t 10s
----
+
This starts the camera and shows a preview window for ten seconds. Once you have verified everything is installed correctly, it's time to run some demos.

=== Demos

The `rpicam-apps` suite of camera applications implements a xref:camera_software.adoc#post-processing-with-rpicam-apps[post-processing framework]. This section contains a few demo post-processing stages that highlight some of the capabilities of the NPU.

The following demos use xref:camera_software.adoc#rpicam-hello[`rpicam-hello`], which by default displays a preview window. However, you can use other `rpicam-apps` instead, including xref:camera_software.adoc#rpicam-vid[`rpicam-vid`] and xref:camera_software.adoc#rpicam-still[`rpicam-still`]. You may need to add or modify some command line options to make the demo commands compatible with alternative applications.

To begin, run the following command to install the latest `rpicam-apps` software package:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install rpicam-apps
----

==== Object Detection

This demo displays bounding boxes around objects detected by a neural network. To disable the viewfinder, use the xref:camera_software.adoc#nopreview[`-n`] flag. To return purely textual output describing the objects detected, add the `-v 2` option. Run the following command to try the demo on your Raspberry Pi:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello -t 0 --post-process-file /usr/share/rpi-camera-assets/hailo_yolov6_inference.json
----

Alternatively, you can try another model with different trade-offs in performance and efficiency.

To run the demo with the Yolov8 model, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello -t 0 --post-process-file /usr/share/rpi-camera-assets/hailo_yolov8_inference.json
----

To run the demo with the YoloX model, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello -t 0 --post-process-file /usr/share/rpi-camera-assets/hailo_yolox_inference.json
----

To run the demo with the Yolov5 Person and Face model, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello -t 0 --post-process-file /usr/share/rpi-camera-assets/hailo_yolov5_personface.json
----

==== Image Segmentation

This demo performs object detection and segments the object by drawing a colour mask on the viewfinder image. Run the following command to try the demo on your Raspberry Pi:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello -t 0 --post-process-file /usr/share/rpi-camera-assets/hailo_yolov5_segmentation.json --framerate 20
----

==== Pose Estimation

This demo performs 17-point human pose estimation, drawing lines connecting the detected points. Run the following command to try the demo on your Raspberry Pi:

[source,console]
----
$ rpicam-hello -t 0 --post-process-file /usr/share/rpi-camera-assets/hailo_yolov8_pose.json
----

=== Alternative Package Versions

The AI Kit and AI HAT+ do not function if there is a version mismatch between the Hailo software packages and device drivers. In addition, Hailo's neural network tooling may require a particular version for generated model files. If you require a specific version, complete the following steps to install the proper versions of all of the dependencies:

. If you have previously used `apt-mark` to hold any of the relevant packages, you may need to unhold them:
+
[source,console]
----
$ sudo apt-mark unhold hailo-tappas-core hailort hailo-dkms
----

. Install the required version of the software packages:
