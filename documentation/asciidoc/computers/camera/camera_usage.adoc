This documentation describes how to use supported camera modules with our software tools. All Raspberry Pi cameras can record high-resolution photographs and full HD 1080p video (or better) with our software tools.

Raspberry Pi produces several official camera modules, including:

* the original 5-megapixel Camera Module 1 (discontinued)
* the 8-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-v2/[Camera Module 2], with or without an infrared filter
* the 12-megapixel https://raspberrypi.com/products/camera-module-3/[Camera Module 3], with both standard and wide lenses, with or without an infrared filter
* the 12-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/[High Quality Camera] with CS and M12 mount variants for use with external lenses
* the 1.6-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-global-shutter-camera/[Global Shutter Camera] for fast motion photography
* the 12-megapixel https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-camera/[AI Camera] uses the Sony IMX500 imaging sensor to provide low-latency, high-performance AI capabilities to any camera application

For more information about camera hardware, see the xref:../accessories/camera.adoc#about-the-camera-modules[camera hardware documentation].

First, xref:../accessories/camera.adoc#install-a-raspberry-pi-camera[install your camera module]. Then, follow the guides in this section to put your camera module to use.

[WARNING]
====
This guide no longer covers the _legacy camera stack_ which was available in Bullseye and earlier Raspberry Pi OS releases. The legacy camera stack, using applications like `raspivid`, `raspistill` and the original `Picamera` (_not_ `Picamera2`) Python library, has been deprecated for many years, and is now unsupported. If you are using the legacy camera stack, it will only have support for the Camera Module 1, Camera Module 2 and the High Quality Camera, and will never support any newer camera modules. Nothing in this document is applicable to the legacy camera stack.
