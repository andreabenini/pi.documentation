=== Known issues

We are aware of the following issues in `libcamera` and `rpicam-apps`.

* On Raspberry Pi 3 (and earlier devices) the graphics hardware can only support images up to 2048Ã—2048 pixels, which places a limit on the camera images that can be resized into the preview window. In practice, this means that video encoding of images larger than 2048 pixels across (which would necessitate using a codec other than h.264) will not support, preview images; or it will produce corrupted preview images. For Raspberry Pi 4, the limit is 4096 pixels. We would recommend using the `-n` (no preview) option.

* The preview window may show some display tearing when using a desktop environment. This is not likely to be fixable.
