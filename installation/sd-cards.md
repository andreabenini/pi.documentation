# SD cards

Raspberry Pi computers use a micro SD card, except for very early models which use a full-sized SD card.

**Note:** Because of a hardware limitation in the Raspberry Pi Zero, 1 and 2, the boot partition on the SD card must be 256GB or smaller otherwise the device will not boot up. Later models of Raspberry Pi 2 with a BCM2837 SoC, Raspberry Pi 3, 4 and 400 do not have this limitation. This does not affect Raspberry Pi OS, which always uses a small boot partition.

## Capacity

We recommend using an SD card of 8GB or greater capacity with Raspberry Pi OS. If you are using the lite version of Raspberry Pi OS, you can use a 4GB card. Other operating systems have different requirements: for example, LibreELEC can run from a smaller card. Please check with the supplier of the operating system to find out what capacity of card they recommend.

## Troubleshooting

We recommend buying an official Raspberry Pi SD card from one of our official resellers. The official SD cards are micro SD cards and are supplied with an adaptor which allows them to be used in a full-sized SD card slot.

If you are having problems with your SD card:

1. Make sure you are using a genuine SD card. The best way to avoid fake SD cards is to always buy from a reputable supplier.
2. Make sure you are using a good quality power supply: we recommend using an official Raspberry Pi power supply.
3. The cable from the power supply unit to the Raspberry Pi can also cause problems. This is usually due to the resistance of the wires in the USB power cable; to save money, USB cables have as little copper in them as possible, which causes a voltage drop across the cable.
4. Make sure you shut down the operating system correctly before you power down the Raspberry Pi.
